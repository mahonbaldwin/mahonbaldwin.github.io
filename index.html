I've had the privilege of working for companies like <a href="https://www.reifyhealth.com/">Reify Health</a>, Nike, and Sling TV as a software engineer. I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and
      I've been professionally programming since 2010. In addition to being a software engineer I'm a futurist and I enjoy
      artificial intelligence, robotics, and designing technology that can solve the real problems of our world.
      Other hobbies include reading, backpacking, rearing my child, and finding new ways to surprise my wife.</p><p><ul><li>If you're interested in my skills or portfolio, just scroll down.</li><li>If you want to know about my work history, you can view it on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahonri" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</li><li>If you're curious why bees store their honey in the little plastic bears I couldn't tell you.</li></ul></p></div></div><div class="kudos section"><h3 id="kudos">#kudos</h3><p class="blurb">Here are some nice things people have said about me.</p><div class="recommendations"><div class="recommendation"><p>I had the pleasure of working with Mahon at OneStudyTeam. Mahon was a senior engineer, and worked as a Clojure developer on our team. More than just a developer, Mahon is an extremely capable problem solver, team member, creative thinker. Mahon was the go-to person on our team for many hard-to-solve problems, as his experience, domain knowledge, and tenacity always made Mahon the person we could rely on in difficult situations. Mahon also brings a great deal of levity to a team, and is a joy to work with. I'd strongly recommend Mahon to any company looking for strong, senior-level talent.<span class="by"> ~ Jeff Stickel, Mahon's manager at ReifyHealth</span></p></div><div class="recommendation"><p>Building software with a good eye to every detail is one of many Mahon’s skills that make working with him a pleasure. Mahon is always proactive and precise in conversation about design and implementation. Not once I was surprised how deeply he thinks about possible issues looking at problems from unusual perspective, caring about user of the final product. Overall, he is a great guy to work with, I had many interesting conversations with him and I am always happy to work with him.<span class="by"> ~ Sen Mikhalëv, coworker at ReifyHealth</span></p></div><div class="recommendation"><p>I have enjoyed working with Mahon for more than two years now. In that time I've been impressed with Mahon's software engineering skills, and with his dedication. Mahon has an intuitive understanding of good software design that few of his peers posses. This understanding is likely due to his drive for improvement—both in terms of his personal growth and improvement in software. He is always working towards a goal of efficient, readable code; at the same time, he knows when it's time to be finished because "perfect is the enemy of good."</p><p>Mahon takes the requisite time to carefully craft code. Anyone who works with him will notice that he doesn't just "get it working" on the "happy path." Rather, he carefully considers edge cases and possible errors. Additionally, he takes the time to truly understand the requirements (too often I've seen what happens when others are less careful).  His careful attentiveness leads to better code, reduced complexity, and overall greater quality of a software product.</p><p>Mahon has all the marks of a great engineer—one that adds value to your code. One that works to understand the business's needs. One that helps those around him to achieve great results. I know that Mahon will go to great places and I hope I have the opportunity to work with him again someday.<span class="by"> ~ David King, coworker at OrangeSoda and SlingTV</span></p></div><div class="recommendation"><p>I had the pleasure of working directly with Mahon for 3 years at OrangeSoda. Mahon is a hard working developer who is focused on making sure that his software is of the highest quality and usability for the customer. He doesn't shy away from expressing his thoughts on how to best implement new features and he is always willing to work with others to figure out what will be best for the end user.</p><p>Mahon seeks to learn more and improve his skills constantly. He is an excellent developer, but that doesn't keep him from seeking new and better ways to code so that the software will be more robust and higher quality.</p><p>I really enjoyed working with Mahon and I'm certain he will be an excellent addition to any company that he works for.<span class="by"> ~ Shawn Hart, coworker at OrangeSoda</span></p></div><div class="recommendation"><p>I have enjoyed working with Mahon, he is an excellent engineer with a keen mind for making good quality software that works properly. He likes to understand the big picture, not just the block of code he is working on today. He goes out of his way to fix technical debt he comes across when possible and encourages others to write long term maintainable code. I think he would be a valuable asset to any software development team.<span class="by"> ~ Bryan Lee, coworker at Nike</span></p></div><div class="recommendation"><p>Mahon has been a very dedicated employee. He has been ethical, loyal and intelligent. He has taken the lead on some of the projects and delivered. He works well the team, a great asset to any company.<span class="by"> ~ Douglas Tiejen, Mahon's manager at PolicyTech</span></p></div></div></div><div class="skills section"><h3 id="skills">#skills</h3><div class="items"><div class="skill"><img src="img/clj.png" alt="Clojure" title="Clojure"></div><div class="skill"><img src="img/cljs.png" alt="ClojureScript" title="ClojureScript"></div><div class="skill"><img src="img/html5.png" alt="HTML5" title="HTML5"></div><div class="skill"><img src="img/postgres.png" alt="Postgres (SQL)" title="Postgres (SQL)"></div></div><div class="full-list"><button>view larger list</button><div class="hidden"><ul class="skill-list"><li>.NET</li><li>AngularJS</li><li>Arduino</li><li>AWS</li><li>Clojure</li><li>ClojureScript</li><li>ColdFusion</li><li>CouchBase</li><li>CSS</li><li>D3</li><li>Datomic</li><li>Google Cloud</li><li>HTML5</li><li>Java</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>jQuery</li><li>JSON</li><li>Kafka</li><li>LESS</li><li>MongoDb</li><li>MSSQL</li><li>MySQL</li><li>NodeJs</li><li>Oracle</li><li>PHP</li><li>Postgres (and other SQL engines)</li><li>React</li><li>SASS</li><li>Scala</li><li>Selenium</li><li>SQL</li><li>XML</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="portfolio section"><h3 id="portfolio">#portfolio</h3><p class="blurb">Most of my professional work has been done for employers, but I have a few fun side projects that you can see here.</p><div class="items"><div class="portfolio-item"><a href="http://cindybaldwinbooks.com" target="_blank"><img src="img/being-cindy.png"></a><div>Cindy Baldwin, author of <i>Where the Watermelons Grow</i>, <i>The Stars of Whistling Ridge</i>, and other children's book posts information about her and her work on this website.
