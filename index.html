          <p><!-- react-text: 19 -->Hi, I'm Mahon (my secret identity must remain unknown). I've had the privilege of
            working for companies like Nike and Sling TV as a software engineer. I've been professionally programming
            since I graduated from <!-- /react-text --><a href="http://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank"> BYU-Idaho</a>
            <!-- react-text: 21 --> in 2010. In addition to
            software development I enjoy reading, hiking, photography, psychology, sociology, sleight of hand, rearing
            my child,
            and finding new ways to surprise my wife.<!-- /react-text --></p>

        <p class="blurb">Here are some nice things people have said about me.</p>
        <div class="recommendations">
          <div class="recommendation"><p>I have enjoyed working with Mahon for more than two years now. In that time
            I've been impressed with Mahon's software engineering skills, and with his dedication. Mahon has an
            intuitive understanding of good software design that few of his peers posses. This understanding is likely
            due to his drive for improvement—both in terms of his personal growth and improvement in software. He is
            always working towards a goal of efficient, readable code; at the same time, he knows when it's time to be
            finished because "perfect is the enemy of good."</p>
            <p>Mahon takes the requisite time to carefully craft code. Anyone who works with him will notice that he
              doesn't just "get it working" on the "happy path." Rather, he carefully considers edge cases and possible
              errors. Additionally, he takes the time to truly understand the requirements (too often I've seen what
              happens when others are less careful). His careful attentiveness leads to better code, reduced complexity,
              and overall greater quality of a software product.</p>
            <p><!-- react-text: 38 -->Mahon has all the marks of a great engineer—one that adds value to your code. One
              that works to understand the business's needs. One that helps those around him to achieve great results. I
              know that Mahon will go to great places and I hope I have the opportunity to work with him again someday.
              <!-- /react-text --><span class="by"> ~ David King</span></p></div>
          <div class="recommendation"><p>I had the pleasure of working directly with Mahon for 3 years at OrangeSoda.
            Mahon is a hard working developer who is focused on making sure that his software is of the highest quality
            and usability for the customer. He doesn't shy away from expressing his thoughts on how to best implement
            new features and he is always willing to work with others to figure out what will be best for the end
            user.</p>
            <p>Mahon seeks to learn more and improve his skills constantly. He is an excellent developer, but that
              doesn't keep him from seeking new and better ways to code so that the software will be more robust and
              higher quality.</p>
            <p><!-- react-text: 44 -->I really enjoyed working with Mahon and I'm certain he will be an excellent
              addition to any company that he works for.<!-- /react-text --><span class="by"> ~ Shawn Hart</span></p>
          </div>
          <div class="recommendation"><p><!-- react-text: 48 -->I have enjoyed working with Mahon, he is an excellent
            engineer with a keen mind for making good quality software that works properly. He likes to understand the
            big picture, not just the block of code he is working on today. He goes out of his way to fix technical debt
            he comes across when possible and encourages others to write long term maintainable code. I think he would
            be a valuable asset to any software development team.<!-- /react-text --><span

          <div class="recommendation"><p><!-- react-text: 52 -->Mahon has been a very dedicated employee. He has been
            ethical, loyal and intelligent. He has taken the lead on some of the projects and delivered. He works well
            the team, a great asset to any company.<!-- /react-text --><span class="by"> ~ Douglas Tiejen</span></p>
